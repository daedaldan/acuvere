  "_comment": "This is hourly data I created to simulate a typical day without intense exercise. The first value in an array is at 1:00 AM and the last value is at 12:00 AM, simulating a full day of sleeping and activity. I think it would be pretty effective even if we just show 24 hrs of data. Lmk what you think. -G",
